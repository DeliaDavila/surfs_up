# Surf’s Up Climate Analysis

## Overview of the analysis
### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to investiate historical temperatures in Oahu in the most popular travel months. This will help determine whether Oahu is the the ideal location for opening the first location of the surf and ice cream shop.
### Background
Previous analysis for this client looked at precipitation and temperature data in Hawaii to help narrow down the ideal location. Weather patterns were looked at using weather station readings. The client requested a website that allows for querying precipication data for a specified data range. The client was pleased but wanted to get further analysis to determine whether the business model of surf shop and ice cream parlour would be a good venture at different points of the calender.

## Results
### June temperature statistics

### December statisistics

### Observations
* The average temperture is almost as warm in December as in June.
    * If the average is a reliable number, the shop would not need to close in winter months.
* The standard deviation in both months is relatively low
    * Low standard deviation indicates that data points are grouped near the average. 
    * Given that the averages six months apart are similar and shown to be consistent, it’s likely that temperatues year-round will be consistent and warm, good weather for a surf shop and ice cream store.
* The maximum temperature on both June and December is in the 80s.
    * This lends support to the idea that the weather is fairly consistent and very well-suited to vacations around the year.
    * Tourist traffic is likely to be consistent throughout the year.

## Summary
### Analysis and opinion
The analysis of temperature statistics for sample months in summer (June) and winter (December) indicate that Oahu is a great location for a surf shop that also sells ice cream. The analysis shows that temperatures are both consistent and consistently warm but not too hot. This suggests that Oahu is an ideal vacation destination and that tourists will be likely throughout the year. Having a surf shop that could appeal to both serious surfers and families just in need of vacation entertainment and snacks would be a great business model.
### Recommendations
I feel confident that the analysis up to this point suggests that Oahu is a great place for this business. Given that the client would like to open several shops, I suggest some further analysis to plan for future sites. 
I would suggest additional analysis to determine if temperature and precipitation varies with the longitude and latitude of different stations. That may help determent whether new locations can be opened anywhere on the islands or would be ideally restricted to areas with ideal low precipitation and consistently warm temperatures.
Once station location has been analyzed, I would suggest additional analysis to gather temperature and precipiation statistics for multiple stations throughout the four seasons. Given the analysis already performed, the results are likely to indicate that weather is consistently nice around the islands. But studying specific stations may help suggest specific locations with the lowest precipication and most consistent temperatures, ideal for beach visits and surfing.
